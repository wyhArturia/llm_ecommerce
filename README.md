This is the code for our paper "LLM Enhanced Machine Learning Estimators for Classification"

The datasets and LLM predictions can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sGk74xYkFSdk8CqoXcNuB38PZmLY4L5v/view?usp=sharing 

After you download the data, put the extracted folder "data" and methods.ipynb under the same directory and run methods.ipynb to replicate results in our paper.

Please directly contact wuyh@berkeley.edu if you have any problem.
